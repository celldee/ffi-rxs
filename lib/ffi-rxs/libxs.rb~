    # @blocking = true is a hint to FFI that the following (and only the following)
    # function may block, therefore it should release the GIL before calling it.
    # This can aid in situations where the function call will/may block and another
    # thread within the lib may try to call back into the ruby runtime. Failure to
    # release the GIL will result in a hang; the hint *may* allow things to run
    # smoothly for Ruby runtimes hampered by a GIL.
    #
    # This is really only honored by the MRI implementation but it *is* necessary
    # otherwise the runtime hangs (and requires a kill -9 to terminate)
