module XS

  # All sockets exist within a context and a context is passed to the
  # Socket constructor when allocating new sockets.
  #
  # Also, Sockets should *only* be accessed from the thread where they
  # were first created. Do *not* pass sockets between threads; pass
  # in the context and allocate a new socket per thread. If you must
  # use threads, then make sure to execute a full memory barrier (e.g.
  # mutex) as you pass a socket from one thread to the next.
  #
  # To connect sockets between contexts, use +inproc+ or +ipc+
  # transport and set up a Crossroads socket between them. This is also the
  # recommended technique for allowing sockets to communicate between
  # threads.
  #
  # @example Create context and socket
  #   context = XS::Context.create
  #   if context
  #     socket = context.socket(XS::REQ)
  #     if socket
  #       ...
  #     else
  #       STDERR.puts "Socket allocation failed"
  #     end
  #   else
  #     STDERR.puts "Context allocation failed"
  #   end
