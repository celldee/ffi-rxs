ffi-rxs
    by Chris Duncan

== DESCRIPTION:

This gem wraps the Crossroads I/O networking library using the ruby FFI (foreign
function interface). It's a pure ruby wrapper so this gem can be loaded
and run by any ruby runtime that supports FFI. That's all of them:
MRI 1.9.x, Rubinius and JRuby.

Crossroads I/O is a fork of ZeroMQ. This gem is a re-working of the ffi-rzmq gem
created by Chuck Remes to provide bindings for the Crossroads I/O libxs C library
instead of the ZeroMQ libzmq library. The gem auto-configures itself to expose
the API conforming to the loaded C library. 

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

This gem needs to be tested in the wild. Please kick its tyres and give it a
good thrashing. It is inevitable that bugs will be discovered, so please open 
issues for them here or fork this project, fix them, and send me a pull
request.

The 'ffi' gem has dropped support for MRI 1.8.x. Since this project relies
on that gem to load and run this code, then this project does not support
MRI 1.8.x. I recommend JRuby for the best performance and stability.

== REQUIREMENTS:

  * Crossroads I/O version 1.0.0 or later.
  
The Crossroads I/O library must be installed on your system in a well-known location
like /usr/local/lib. This is the default for new Crossroads I/O installs.

Future releases may include the library as a C extension built at
time of installation.

  * ffi (>= 1.0.0)
  
Do *not* run this gem under MRI with an old 'ffi' gem. It will crash randomly and
you will be sad.

== INSTALL:

A full gem has been released to rubygems.org as of release 0.1.0.
Make sure the Crossroads I/O library is already installed on your system.

 % gem install ffi-rxs # should grab the latest release


To build from git master:

 % git clone git://github.com/celldee/ffi-rxs
 % cd ffi-rxs
 % gem build ffi-rxs.gemspec
 % gem install ffi-rxs-*.gem
 

NOTE for Windows users!
In order for this gem to find the libxs.dll, it *must* be on the Windows PATH. Google
for "modify windows path" for instructions on how to do that if you are unfamiliar with
that activity.
